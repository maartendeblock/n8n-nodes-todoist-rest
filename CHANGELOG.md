## [2.0.0-beta.1] - 2025-08-27

### ðŸš€ Major Changes
- **BREAKING**: Migrated from Todoist REST API v2 to the new unified Todoist API v1
- API endpoint changed from `api.todoist.com/rest/v2/` to `api.todoist.com/api/v1/`
- All resource IDs are now opaque strings instead of numeric values for future compatibility

### âœ¨ New Features  
- **Parent/Subtask Management**: Full support for task parent-child relationships
  - Create subtasks directly with `parent_id` parameter in task creation
  - Convert existing tasks to subtasks via update operation with `parent_id`
  - Remove parent relationship (convert subtask back to regular task) by updating with empty `parent_id`
- **Enhanced Task Retrieval**: Added `includeSubtasks` option to get task operation
  - Automatically fetches and includes all subtasks when retrieving a parent task
  - Subtasks returned in a `subtasks` array on the parent task object

### ðŸ”§ Improvements
- **Cursor-based Pagination**: Support for all list operations (tasks, projects, sections, labels, comments)
- **Advanced Task Filtering**: Dedicated `/tasks/filter` endpoint with natural language filter support
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Improved API response processing and error messages
- **Better Response Structure**: All list operations now use `results` array structure

### Technical Details
- Automatic pagination handling with `next_cursor` support
- Response structure now includes `results` array for list operations
- Maintains full backwards compatibility in n8n interface
- All existing functionality preserved while gaining performance improvements

### Migration Notes
- No changes required for existing workflows - all n8n interfaces remain the same
- Existing credentials continue to work unchanged
- Better performance for large data sets due to improved pagination
- Enhanced reliability with the new unified API structure
